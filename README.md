Activity-Tracker
================

### One place to see all my activities (Runs, Rides, Lifts)

Features:
* Strava Integration to see __Runs__ and __Rides__
* Manual Entry of __Lifts__
* Stats

Tech Stack (_proposed_):
* Node.js + Express (_backend_)
* Backbone.js SPA (_frontend_)

TODO:
1. Express's built in generator will generate a new project root, but we've already made one.
Use the generator and copy the files over to the original root.
2. Install and use SASS, COMPASS, Backbone.js
